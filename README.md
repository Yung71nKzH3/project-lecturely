Lecturely.

A program responsible for helping students acting as an assistant during lectures for when the lecturer went onto the next slide too quick. For taking notes without even having to take them and then making those notes incredibly easier to go back through later on without you're terrible handwriting becoming a problem.

Videos, virtual notes, voice recording, clipping, STT. All in one to help notetaking become easier.
